# Advanced-SQL-practice

For the practice below, I used the following database: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Qsnn3bg0_PYgY5kKJOUDG8xdKLvOLPK/view?usp=sharing

I accessed the database through Biq query, which I used to run my SQL queries.

The database consists of six schemas, each consisting of different tables joined on different primary and foreign keys
  1. dbo
  2. purchasing
  3. person
  4. production
  5. human resources and sales
